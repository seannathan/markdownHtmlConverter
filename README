#MarkdownHtmlConverter

This is a markdown to HTML converter for the homework assignment. It utilizes a tree type structure
and reads a markdown file and builds an n-ary tree based on the constraints provided in the assignment
for generating HTML. From this tree, the HTMLGenerator traverses the tree and uses the Jsoup library
to build HTML elements in order and saves the file

##How to run
1. Make sure you have Apache Maven installed on your machine
2. From the project directory in Bash, type mvn install
3. The tests should run once the dependencies in the pom.xml file are installed and
the output files should be created.

##Running from IDE
1. If Maven is installed and you just want to run the main App class, open IDE (IntelliJ)
and run the App class. Output files should be generated.
